# MHZ-14-PWM-by-Interrupt
Simple Interrupt driven CO2 level measurement  for microcontroller projects (Arduino/ESP32/ESP8266 etc)

This code is offered as a simple but very reliable and accurate means of measuring the Pulse Width Ratio of the output from an MHZ-14/17 type sensor.  It requires no complex classes or libraries and will run with minimal interference (or possible none at all!) to other running code/
